[i]$!{ex_antonia} leaned over to whisper to you. In the dark theater, ${ex_her_p}
[i]breath on your ear made you tingle.

[i]"This movie is boring," ${ex_she} said, "Let's go do something more exciting."

[i]You left your seats and hurried down the aisle of the movie theater hand in
[i]hand. You hoped ${ex_she} couldn't feel how sweaty your palm was; hear how
[i]hard your heart was beating in your chest.

[i]Outside, the light was blinding. The pseudo-alley behind the theater was
[i]deserted of people. Before you could fully get your bearings, $!{ex_antonia}
[i]pushed you against the wall and leaned ${ex_her_p} body into yours, maximizing
[i]contact. $!{ex_she} leaned ${ex_her_p} face in beside your neck, not quite
[i]touching your skin with ${ex_her_p} lips.

[i]How did you feel about this?

*fake_choice
    #Nervous. I wasn't sure how far I was ready to go.
        [i]You closed your eyes. Your breathing became shorter. You put your
        [i]hands against $!{ex_antonia}'s sides to push ${ex_her} away, but at
        [i]the last moment couldn't bring yourself to. It felt too nice.

    #Nervous. A movie might have let out and we could've been caught.
        [i]Your breathing became shorter. You glanced around nervously. You put
        [i]your hands against $!{ex_antonia}'s sides to push ${ex_her} away, but
        [i]at the last moment couldn't bring yourself to. It felt too nice.

    #Excited. A movie might have let out and we could've been caught.
        [i]You closed your eyes. Your breathing became shorter. You put your
        [i]hands around $!{ex_antonia}'s waist to hold ${ex_her} closer. You
        [i]strained your ears, hoping to hear a theater door open.

    #Excited. $!{ex_her_p} closeness was driving me wild.
        [i]You closed your eyes. Your breathing became shorter. You put your
        [i]hands around $!{ex_antonia}'s waist to hold ${ex_her} closer. You
        [i]almost couldn't stand ${ex_her_p} teasing your any longer.

[i]$!{ex_antonia} finally kissed your neck, your jaw line. Your lips met and you
[i]felt like you were spinning, like the ground had vanished under you. Kissing
[i]${ex_her} was always like this.

[i]After some unknown period of time, the two of you broke off. $!{ex_she}
[i]smiled at you, both of you breathing heavily, still reveling in your
[i]closeness. Standing there, close to ${ex_her}, smelling ${ex_her_p} shampoo,
[i]you realized something.

[i]"A-${ex_antonia}," you said, then stopped. You'd never said this to anyone
[i]before and weren't sure of yourself. $!{ex_she} just tilted ${ex_her_p} head
[i]to the side and looked back and forth between your eyes, so you took a deep
[i]breath and said, "$!{ex_antonia}, I love you."

[i]Instantly, you knew it was a mistake. The light in $!{ex_antonia}'s face
[i]vanished and ${ex_she} averted ${ex_her_p} eyes. $!{ex_she} pushed back from
[i]you. The suddenly cool air where ${ex_her_p} body had been felt like daggers.

[i]"Oh," ${ex_she} mumbled, "Yeah, uhâ€¦" $!{ex_she} shuffled ${ex_her_p} feet and
[i]looked down, tucking some loose hair behind ${ex_her_p} ear. After a moment
[i]more of awkward silence ${ex_she} blurted out, "I gotta go," and walked, then
[i]jogged, then ran to where the two of you had locked up your bikes together
[i]and rode off alone.

[i]All you could do through this was to stare in horror. As soon as you saw
[i]${ex_her_p} face change, your heart stopped. The bottom fell out of your gut.
[i]It was hard to breathe. What had you just done?


*page_break

[i]An hour or so later, you had finally got yourself back together enough to
[i]petal over to Kaitlin's apartment. As soon as she opened the door, you burst
[i]out crying. Out of fear. Out of confusion. Out of shame. You felt like you
[i]had done something wrong, but you weren't even sure what, or what would
[i]happen because of it.

[i]The next day, you spent the entire bus ride to school with your stomach in a
[i]tight knot. You moved through your day in a haze when you realized that
[i]$!{ex_antonia} was completely avoiding you.

[i]It was a week before you finally admitted to yourself that you were broken
[i]up. $!{ex_she} didn't tell you ${ex_she}'d dumped you; ${ex_she} didn't say
[i]anything at all to you in that time. Kaitlin managed to get you out of your
[i]funk enough to deal with finals, and then it was summer break and on the
[i]second day, you saw $!{ex_antonia} at the pool with Mercedes. They were
[i]holding hands.
